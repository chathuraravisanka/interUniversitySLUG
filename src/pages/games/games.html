  <p>Inter-University sports championships have been organized since the latter part of the 1950s. The first University Sports 
  Festival was held in 1980 at the University of Peradeniya in response to a suggestion made by the Director of Physical 
  Education of the University of Peradeniya, Mr. Lesley Handunge. Mr. Lesley Handunge, a graduate of the University of 
  Peradeniya himself, was a skilled sportsman who had represented Sri Lanka twice in boxing at the Olympic Games. 
  Furthermore, as he had led the Sri Lankan team at the World University Sports Festival and at a number of other 
  international sports festivals. Mr. Handunge was able to organize a festival among universities in keeping with 
  the standards and traditions of the Olympic Games. Thus, following this tradition, the Sri Lankan universities 
  organize a festival once in three years and the Wayamba University of Sri Lanka organized XII Sri Lanka University Games in 2016.
